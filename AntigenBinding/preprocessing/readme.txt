1. match the align.csv with protein folding matrix's title
--> give back informations with antigens and concatenated protein folding matrixs
2. one hot encode the cdr3 and v j genes
--> give back cdr3_onehot and vj_onehot
3. choose the last 40 amino acids of protein folding matrix
--> give back concatenated last 40 amino acid protein folding matrixs
